  Glad to share my experience during the holiday with the machine learning by watching the *codefree* on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=2124s
  In this way, I could make it out what the structrue is.
  To be honest, the code difficulty is not highï¼Œ however the imitation of neural networks and the optimization of gradient descent lead to the greatest product.
  At first, I just learned a lot from these.By the way, there are so many sources on the YouTube.
